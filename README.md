# Rust Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress learning the Rust programming language.  
Here you'll find exercises, small projects, notes, and resources as I work through tutorials and challenges.

## Structure
- `exercises/` — Practice problems and coding exercises  
- `projects/` — Small projects to apply concepts  

## Goals
- Understand Rust basics and syntax  
- Learn ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes  
- Build projects to solidify knowledge  

Feel free to follow along or contribute!
